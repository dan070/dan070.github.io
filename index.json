Lately, it\u0026rsquo;s been Adam Savage and his builds. There is something soothing about watching active creation. I love tinkering and building, but not on his level (of obsession). I guess as a data-guy, the inner workings of the world is what drives me. Empiricist. And creating stuff with your hands is a part of that \u0026ldquo;hands-on\u0026rdquo; experience - I consider programming to be in that league.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of books lately, and has been amazed at how much things makes sense at the moment, and a week later it\u0026rsquo;s *poof* \u0026hellip; leaving just a wage notion of concepts, like waking up from a beautiful dream. A pop-lecture on youtube today 1 reminded me about what I have come to appreciate more and more with age: After you learn it, you have to make it your own, by actually outputing it back again.\nWays of actually learning The basic ways of actually learning something :\n reflect implement and use share with others  Doing more moocs and linkedin learning and what-not helps naught : I simply haven\u0026rsquo;t put in the time to reflect, implement and talk about it. All those hours have more or less been lost on me. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard lesson, right there.\nLove matters. As does money. It all boils down to a simple formula for happy-as-a-clam-at-high-tide :\nflowchart LR; A((market demand)); B((relevant skills)); C((love doing it)); A \u0026lt;--\u0026gt; C; B \u0026lt;--\u0026gt; C; A \u0026lt;--\u0026gt; B;  This models me as a carrot-driven (\u0026ldquo;love doing it\u0026rdquo;) knowledge worker (\u0026ldquo;relevant skills\u0026rdquo;) chasing the money (\u0026ldquo;market demand\u0026rdquo;). Not entirely untrue. However, at home with small kids, reading and listening (input) is easier, but without space to write or create (output). At work, output is mush easier to defend and input is not considered working2. Also: finding the right project at work that balances development of self, business value and client satisfaction is mostly an impossible triage.\nThe Savage lesson Unfortunately, time doesn\u0026rsquo;t wait, so this means a more deliberate, thorough, exercise when-ever I do learn something new. Reflect. Implement. Share. I wish this would have been imparted into my younger self, who lusted more for new sights than for mastery and power. I think that the lesson from Adam Savage is to finish the build, and reflect and share honestly with others.\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVO8Wt_PCgE\u0026t=943s\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Manager: \u0026ldquo;What if we pay them to upskill, and they leave afterwards?\u0026rdquo; HR: \u0026ldquo;What if we don\u0026rsquo;t, and they stay?\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1628467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628526614,"objectID":"0569a32115793bdab34fab6387890b36","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/output-is-the-new-black/","publishdate":"2021-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/output-is-the-new-black/","section":"post","summary":"Learning is a hands-on business Once in a while I binge-watch youtube.
